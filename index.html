<!--
Purpose of Website:
- Show off my CS skills
- Display my projects in an interactive way
- Include a short description for each project, challenges, things learnt
- Over the years, this website will show my progression from first year UofT

I don't want this to be boring, I want to impress people with it
I'm thinking make it like a video game, with a menu for people to select,
the 'levels' will be my projects over the years.

Here is the hierarchy of my website:
Menu:
Projects:
    Gallery / list of my projects, with a pick for each:
        Clicked to view description, challenges, things learnt, and hopefully, something interactive
        (if the project is a game / small application, try to make it accessible in the site or post git link)
Achievements
    Awards / Work Experience and roles. No need to be too specific, just briefly state 'I worked at
    <company> as a <role> and worked on <job responsibilities>'
    Would this be a privacy issue?
Credits:
        Bio about me, my education, interests, etc.
